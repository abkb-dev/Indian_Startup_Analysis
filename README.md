## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

1. **Loading Data**: Original dataset `startup_funding.csv`.  

2. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - `Investors Name` missing → filled with `'Undisclosed'`.  
   - Dropped rows with missing `vertical`, `city`, or `round`.  

3. **Column Renaming**: Renamed for clarity:
   ```python
    Date dd/mm/yyyy → date
    Startup Name → startup
    Industry Vertical → vertical
    SubVertical → subvertical
    City Location → city
    Investors Name → investors
    InvestmentnType → round
    Amount in USD → amount
   ```  

5. **Amount Column Cleaning**:
      - Removed commas and non-numeric entries.  
      - Converted USD to INR (crores).  

5. **Date Column Cleaning**:
      - Converted type of date column from `object` to `datetime64[ns]`.  
      - Extracted `year` and `month` for analysis.  

6. **Investor List**:
      - Split multiple investors per startup and created a unique, sorted list for dropdown selection.  

7. **Export Cleaned Data**: `startup_cleaned.csv` for Streamlit app consumption.
